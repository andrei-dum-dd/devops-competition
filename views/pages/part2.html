                <p>As Stewie ponders on what to do next, he suddenly feels a hand touching his shoulder. When he turns around, he sees himself – but we are talking about his own version in that timeline <b>(Stewie2)</b>.</p>
                <p><b>Stewie2:</b> What on earth are you doing here? What have you come to prevent?!</p>
                <p><b>Stewie:</b> Well you know that Brian is in the hospital now – and in my timeline, he never recovers back! I need…we need to prevent him from going into that car entirely!</p>
                <img class="img-right" src="/images/quantum-cpu.jpg" alt="">
                <p><b>Stewie2</b>: In that case we need to fix the time machine, since it appears to be entirely fried!</p>
                <p>So, two of the greatest minds now must find a way to repair the damage.</p>
                <p>After some time, they both agree that they need the following components to fix it:</p>
                
                    <ul>Hydrogen Subparticle Generator</ul>
                    <ul>Quantum CPU</ul>
                    <ul>Flux Capacitor :) </ul>
                
                 <p>But as you can imagine, officially, some of these components do not even exist in the 21th Century. However, it is possible to create these parts with the current technology, we are talking about Stewie Griffin after all! If only they had access to a military facility, and most important the R&D part of that facility...</p>  
                 <p>Military facilities are nothing strange to Stewie – most of the gadgets he invented have parts that either come from one or he sells gadgets that he creates via a “Black Market” online to them.</p>
                 <p>And just as luck has it, there is one such facility near Quahog – but it sure will be heavily guarded.</p>

                 <p>I have an idea! - says Stewie.</p>

                 <p><b>Stewie:</b> we could get the Quantum CPU from a most unexpected source - Russia!</p>

                 <p><b>Stewie2:</b> how in the world did you come up with that idea?</p>

                 <p><b>Stewie:</b> think about it - Peter is a very good friend of Vladimir Putin. If we could somehow get in touch with him...but we need to impersonate Peter somehow.</p>

                 <p><b>Stewie2:</b> I know! We could use the <u>VoiceR</u> gadget! The same one we used to prank Brian by pretending to be one of his ex-girlfriends over the phone?</p>

                 <p><b>Stewie:</b> You are a genius! Actually - we both are given the circumstances!</p>

                 <p>After coming up with this idea, the two big brained little boys put their plan in action. Using Peter's phone, they call Vladimir - and thanks to the <u>VoiceR</u>  gadget, they sound just like Peter! He won't suspect a thing!</p>

                <p>Apparently, getting the Quantum CPU was easier than they thought. They promised Vladimir that he (Peter) will visit Russia and spend time together - in exchange the CPU will shipped to their house via a maximum security courier. Convenient!</p>
                <img class="img-left" src="/images/vlad.png">
                <p>Within 24 hours they receive the CPU - a heavy safe is airdropped right on their house. Perhaps this is Russia's way of delivering secure packages - who knows? </p>

                <p>Once component down - two more to go! Time machine is now 50% completed! Continue to complete the DevOps tasks to unveil more of the story!</p>
